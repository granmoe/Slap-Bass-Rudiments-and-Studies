# How to Slap

## Right Hand Posture

> Fingers curled under in a "C," thumb held out, minimal tension

Hold your hand so that your palm is facing the ground with your hand open. Make sure there is no bend in your wrist, so that your hand is in a straight line with your forearm.

Now curl your fingers slightly, so that they're in a comfortable "C" shape. This should require very little tension.

From this position of minimal tension in the hand, pull your thumb back slightly to create a gap between your thumb and hand.

Let your thumb hang out comfortably a little ways from your hand. There should be a gap of about 30ยบ to 45ยบ between your thumb and hand, but you'll dial in this position over time based on what's most effective for you. Just don't leave your thumb laying flat against your hand, or sticking way out at a 90ยบ angle.

## Forearm and Thumb Motion

> Wrist straight, rotate the forearm, swing thumb loosely

While keeping as little tension as possible in your right hand in order to maintain the posture described above, **begin rotating your forearm through its full range of motion**, back and forth, like you're turning a door handle or screwing in a lightbulb, so that your palm faces towards you at the start of the rotation and away from you at the end. Remember to keep your wrist straight. Keep things loose, keep your thumb stuck out slightly from your hand, but otherwise **let your whole thumb move freely.**

Continue rotating your forearm and loosen up your thumb as much as you can while maintaining its position slightly away from your hand. Experiment with moving your thumb closer and further from your hand. Feel the inertia of your thumb throughout the motion. Notice that the thumb does not move exactly in time with your hand, but lags behind a little. **This slight "bounciness" is what allows your thumb to quickly come off the string so that it doesn't dampen it, producing the greatest output with the least effort.** Mallet instruments, like marimba, xylophone or vibraphone, operate on this same principle.

Also notice that if you tense up everything in your hand as much as you can, this thumb inertia decreases. Go ahead and turn your hand into concrete so nothing can move freely and notice how this feels. Now make your hand as loose as possible and continue rotating your forearm. Notice again that the "bounciness" of your thumb increases when you swing it loosely. Gradually tense your hand to go back towards the posture we practiced above. As you stabilize your fingers by curling them in, the centrifugal force of your thumb increases. Repeat this change from completely loose to holding your hand in the slap posture a few times.

Now pay attention to the point at which your thumb starts retracting back to the starting position. **The point just before this retraction is where your thumb has the most force to impart to the string.** If you're doing this right, then when you stop your forearm rotation at the end of its range of motion without retracting back to the starting position, your thumb should bounce a few times.

In short, your forearm rotation is the engine, and your thumb is a mallet. This forearm and thumb motion is the core of slap bass technique. Developing speed and coordination with this movement takes time. I recommend practicing it until you can do about two full rotations per second before moving on.

## Point of Contact

Hitting the string with the soft, fleshy part of your thumb makes it difficult to get a loud, clear slap. **Aim to strike with the side of the thumb, anywhere on or near the side of the thumb joint. **This is another fine point of technique that you'll have to dial in over time. For now, just don't get too far away from the thumb joint.

Practice striking your chest \(on the sternum works well since it's a flat, hard surface\) with this part of your thumb. Aim to hit your chest with the hard side edge of your thumb described above as precisely as you can. When you can consistently strike a big, flat surface with this part of your thumb, continue on to the next section.

## Where to Hit the String

Before we start hitting the strings, **position your right hand just after the last fret of the bass.** This area is your point of contact on the string, which, through practice, will connect with the point of contact on your thumb.

When the string travels down from the slap, it will strike the last fret of the bass to create the recognizable, metallic "slap" sound.

This area of the string is easiest to get a solid slap sound from, and it will be your "home" when slapping. It's also the point where the strings have the least resistance to moving towards the fretboard \(in the area not lying over the fretboard\). Note that we don't want to hit the area of the string that lies over the fretboard, but this might happen when you're first starting out.

## Slapping an Actual Bass String :D

Now recall the exercises we did above. After you have the motion going again with your thumb nice and bouncy, **practice hitting the lowest string of your bass just after the last fret with the hard edge of your thumb. **Aim to contact the string close to your thumb joint, but keep up the speed of your wrist rotation even though you'll miss the string sometimes.

Keep practicing slapping the open E string to develop consistency. Now try slapping the A string for a while. Now try to slap one string, then another in tempo. It's going to take time to develop the accuracy to strike the string that you want to. This will come with practice. For now, just practice enough so that you can somewhat consistently switch back and forth between slapping the E string and the A string. It takes time to build new muscle memory. **"Aim small, miss small."**

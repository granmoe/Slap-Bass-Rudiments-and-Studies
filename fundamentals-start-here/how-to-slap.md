# How to Slap

## Right Hand Posture

> Fingers curled under in a "C," thumb held out, minimal tension

Hold your hand so that your palm is facing the ground with your hand open. Make sure there is no bend in your wrist, so that your hand is in a straight line with your forearm.

Now curl your fingers slightly, so that they're in a comfortable "C" shape. This should require very little tension.

From this position of minimal tension in the hand, pull your thumb back slightly to create a gap between your thumb and hand.

Aim for a gap of slightly more than 45ยบ. You'll dial in this position over time based on what's most effective for you.

## Forearm and Thumb Motion

> Wrist straight, rotate the forearm, swing thumb loosely

While keeping as little tension as possible in your right hand in order to maintain the posture described above, begin rotating your forearm through its full range of motion, back and forth. Remember to keep your wrist straight. Although you need a little tension to keep your thumb held out from your hand, **your base thumb joint \(where it connects to your hand\) should be completely loose.**

Continue rotating your forearm and loosen up your thumb as much as you can while maintaining its position slightly away from your hand. Feel the motion of your thumb. Notice that the thumb does not move exactly in time with your hand, but lags behind a little. **This slight "bounciness" is what allows your thumb to quickly bounce off the string so that it doesn't dampen it, producing the greatest output with the least effort.** Mallet instruments, like marimba, xylophone or vibraphone, operate on this same principle.

Now notice that if you tense up everything in your hand as much as you can, this momentum decreases. Go ahead and turn your hand into concrete and notice how this feels. Now go back to the loose hand posture. Notice again that the "bounciness" of your thumb increases when you swing it loosely. Pay attention to the point at which your thumb starts retracting back to the starting position. **The point just before this retraction is where your thumb has the most momentum to impart to the string.** If you're doing this right, then when you stop your forearm rotation at the end of its range of motion \(don't retract it back to the starting position\), your thumb should bounce a few times.

In short, your forearm rotation is the engine, and your thumb is a mallet.

## Point of Contact

The part of your thumb that strikes the string makes a world of difference. Hitting the string with the soft, fleshy part of your thumb will make it difficult to get a loud, clear slap. **Aim to strike with the side of the thumb, anywhere from the side of the last thumb joint and up, but not too close to the thumb tip.** This is roughly the first half of the side of the thumb between the last thumb joint and the thumb tip.

Practice striking your chest \(on the sternum works well since it's a flat, hard surface\) with this part of your thumb. Aim to hit your chest with the hard side edge of your thumb described above as precisely as you can. When you can consistently strike a big, flat surface with this part of your thumb, continue on to the next section.

## How to Hold the Bass

This is a quick refresher on how to position the bass, and left and right hand positioning. If you already know this stuff, skip ahead to the next section.

## Slapping an Actual Bass String :D

Before we start hitting the strings, **position your right hand just after the last fret of the bass.** This area is your point of contact on the string, which, through practice, will connect with the point of contact on your thumb.

When the string travels down from the slap, it will strike the last fret of the bass to create the recognizable metallic "slap" sound.

Note that we don't want to hit the area of the string that lies over the fretboard, but this might happen when you're first starting out \(especially if you aren't used to having your right hand so close to the last fret\). This position is easiest to get a solid slap sound from, and it will be your "home" while slapping, even if you venture away from it sometimes. \(Later on in your life as a slap bassist, you can vary where exactly you strike the string in order to get different sounding articulations.\)

Now recall the exercises we did above. After you have the motion going again with your thumb nice and bouncy, **practice hitting the lowest string of your bass just after the last fret with the hard edge of your thumb. **Remember that hitting with any part of the side of your thumb from the knuckle to the area just above it will work well.

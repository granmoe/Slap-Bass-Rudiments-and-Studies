# How to Slap

## Right Hand Posture

Hold your hand so that your palm is facing the ground with your hand open. Make sure there is no bend in your wrist, so that your hand is in a straight line with your forearm.

Now curl your fingers slightly, so that they're in a comfortable "C" shape. This should require very little tension.

From this position of minimal tension in the hand, pull your thumb back slightly to create a gap between your thumb and hand.

Aim for a gap of slightly more than 45ยบ. You'll dial in this position over time based on what's most effective for you.

## Forearm and thumb motion

While keeping as little tension as possible in your right hand in order to maintain the posture described above, begin rotating your forearm through its full range of motion, back and forth. Remember to keep your wrist straight. Although you need a little tension to keep your thumb held out from your hand, your base thumb joint \(where it connects to your hand\) should be completely loose.

Continue rotating your forearm and loosen up your thumb as much as you can while maintaining its position slightly away from your hand. Feel the motion of your thumb. Notice that the thumb does not move exactly in time with your hand, but lags behind a little. This slight "bounciness" is what allows your thumb to quickly bounce off the string so that it doesn't dampen it, producing the greatest output with the least effort. Mallet instruments, like marimba, xylophone or vibraphone, operate on this same principle.

Now notice that if you tense up everything in your hand as much as you can, this momentum decreases. Go ahead and turn your hand into concrete and notice how this feels. Now go back to the loose hand posture. Notice again that the "bounciness" of your thumb increases when you swing it loosely. If you're doing this right, then when you stop your forearm rotation at the end of its range of motion \(don't retract it back to the starting position\), your thumb should bounce a few times.

In short, your forearm rotation is the engine, and your thumb is a mallet.

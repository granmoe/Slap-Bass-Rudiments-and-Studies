# How to Pop

## Starting From "Hooked" Position

> Pull the fingerpad up and through the string

We'll start by just getting into the position from which the pop starts. Put your index finger's fingertip against the string, and curl it under the string slightly. You don't have to hook under the string very much in order to get the sound.

Now rotate your wrist back and allow your fingertip to pull up and through the string, pulling the string along with it for a little ways.

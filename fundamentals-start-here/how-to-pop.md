# How to Pop

## Finger position

> Pull the fingerpad up and through the string

Put your index finger's fingertip against the string, and curl it under the string slightly. Aim to have the string lie across approximately the middle of your fingertip.

## Movement

Now rotate your wrist back and allow your fingertip to pull up and through the string, pulling the string up along with it for a little ways \(not far, maybe a centimeter, depending on your action and scale length\). Pull the string up enough so that you can feel a good amount of resistance. This is what makes it forcefully slap back down against the frets. One caveat: it's much easier to do this consistently and develop the right feel if you practice popping fretted notes only at first. Popping the open strings feels different due to the string having much less resistance, and it takes some finesse. Once you have the basic technique down on fretted notes, practice popping the open strings. Then practice popping up and down the fretboard, and mixing in open string pops.
